      <h2>How And Why We Use Information</h2>

      <h3>Purposes for Using Information</h3>

    	<ul>
        <li>To provide our Services;</li>
      	<li>To further develop and improve our Services, for example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will make our Services more efficient;</li>
      	<li>To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;</li>
      	<li>To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of us and our users, which may result in us declining the use of our Services;</li>

      	<li>To personalize your experience using our Services and serve relevant advertisements.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</h3>
      <p>A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>(1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you to enable access to our Services on your device; or</li>
      	<li>(2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or</li>
      	<li>(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or</li>
      	<li>(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information, for example, to provide and update our Services, to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience, to safeguard our Services, to communicate with you, to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition, to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, and to personalize your experience; or</li>
      	<li>(5) You have given us your consent to do so for one or more specific purposes.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Sharing Information</h2>

      <h3>How We Share Information</h3>
      <p>We do not sell our users’ private personal information. We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Third Party Vendors</b>: We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you and those that help us understand and enhance our Services, like data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service and marketing efforts. We may allow selected third parties to use tracking technology on the Services, which will enable them to collect data about how you interact with the Services over time. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity.
        </li>
        <li><b>Legal Requests</b>:  We may disclose information about you where such disclosure is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person. We may also disclose your personal data where such disclosure is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure.</li>
        <li><b>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others</b>: We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of us, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>
        <li><b>Business Transfers</b>: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li><b>Aggregated or De-Identified Information</b>: We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services and we may share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.</li>
        <li><b>Published Support Requests</b>: And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Transferring Information</h3>
      <p>The information about you that we process when you use the Services in the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by third party data processors outside the European Economic Area (EEA). This is required for the purposes listed in the Third Party Vendors section above. When providing information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law.</p>

      <h3>Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others</h3>
      <p>Ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered by advertising networks. Other parties may also provide analytics services via our Services. These ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver advertisements that may be more targeted to your interests. Please note this Privacy Policy does not cover the collection of information by any third party advertisers or analytics providers.</p>


      <h2>How Long We Keep Information</h2>
      <p>We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it, which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information, and we are not legally required to continue to keep it. No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>


      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>


      <h2>Minors</h2>
      <p>The Services are not directed to individuals under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under age 13. By using our Services, you represent that you are at least 13. If we learn that personal information from users less than 13 years of age has been collected, we will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us.</p>


      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (AKA the “GDPR”), data protection laws give you rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Request access to your personal data;</li>
      	<li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>
      	<li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>
      	<li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and</li>
      	<li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren’t able to do that, or you would like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to Contact Us section. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data upon request. EU individuals also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.</p>


      <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to the Privacy Policy. We may notify you of significant changes by in-app notification or by email. Your further use of our Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.</p>
